# Amiga-Bouncing-Ball-Recreation
This was my capstone project for my Computer Science major at the University of Indianapolis. I used C++ and OpenGL to attempt a recreation of the Amiga Bouncing ball demo. Written and compiled on Linux. Because this is a graphical program, this will not work on the Windows Subsystem for Linux.
